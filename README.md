#### Description
For project 3 I plan to make an app using ARKit that allows the user to accurately measure real world objects using AR. When the user taps the screen an arrow will start at the center of the screen and when the user moves the phone the arrow will extend to where the center of the screen is now. Next to this arrow there will be two accurate measurements in inches and centimeters.

When the application first opens the user needs to slowly move the device around so the camera can start to detect a plane in the real world. As indicated by the text in the bottom left of the screen.

The yellow dots that will start to appear are called Feature Points they help the virtual objects that are placed stay were they are originally placed. They also show planes that the camera has detected

#### Limitations
Since ARKit was introduced in Septemeber of 2017 it is still new. ARKit does not the ability to recognize real world object or track moving real world objects.
