I plan to make an app using ARKit that allows the user to accurately measure things using AR. When the user taps the screen an arrow will start at the center of the screen and when the user moves the phone the arrow will extend to where the center of the screen is now. Next to this arrow there will be two accurate measurements in inches and centimeters.
